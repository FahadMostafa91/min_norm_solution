# min_norm_solution
Consider a linear system of equations Ax=b.  If the system is overdetermined, the least squares (approximate) solution minimizes ||b−Ax||2. Some source sources also mention ||b−Ax||.  If the system is underdetermined one can calculate the minimum norm solution. But it does also minimize ||b−Ax||
