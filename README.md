# min_norm_solution: question and algorithm attached, thanks to Dr Iyer of TTU Math for teaching this method in control optimization class
Consider a linear system of equations Ax=b.  If the system is overdetermined, the least squares (approximate) solution minimizes ||b−Ax||^2. Some sources also mention ||b−Ax||^2.  If the system is underdetermined one can calculate the minimum norm solution. But it does also minimize ||b−Ax||^2
